  <p>Vandrehallen art gallery is pleased to announce, “A State of Wandering,” Danish artist Julie Sass’s solo project upcoming in fall 2023. The exhibition, which is the artist's most theatrical and encompassing to date, includes painting, drawing, graphics and textiles, as well as the artist's own book publications. Sass aims to explore how she can transform the space in the Vandrehallen so that the audience will inevitably engage with it, regardless of whether they are regular users of the Hillerød Library or not. For the duration of the exhibition, the usual experience of the space will be completely altered.</p>

  <p><strong>Baroque Presentation Techniques</strong><br/>
  Sass draws inspiration from the lavish church or palace halls of the Baroque era,where art was presented in a way that emphasized its dramatic and grandiose nature. With this foundation, Sass establishes parallels to Vandrehallen's 70-meter-long passageway, which connects the various facilities of the Hillerød Library. The 8-meter ceiling height of Vandrehallen and the indirect lighting further enhance the associations with the cathedral-like space and the library's institutional status as a center of knowledge and enlightenment.<br/>
  In this contemporary setting, Sass employs several exhibition techniques and devices from the Baroque era, among which is the conscious creation of visual contrasts. This is achieved by hanging artworks of varied sizes next to each other and by covering and draping walls and fixed decorations with textiles, creating a soft counterpoint to the two-dimensional works. The goal is to create a cohesive aesthetic experience that is simultaneously full of tension and coherence within a fully enveloped art space.</p>
