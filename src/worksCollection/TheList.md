    <p>The software application displaying on the center screen reads an extensive list of known phobias out loud, while displaying their definitions on screen. The graphical applications on the remaining screens turns images of individually selected phobias into cellular automataâ€”the rules of which are generated by the application itself. The work centers on notions of time and development, and is interested in the bright and dark futures associated with new technology.</p>
    <p>The work was shown on "Fontaine", curated by Line Sandvad Mengers. Artists: Kristoffer Akselbo, Luise Sejersen, Lise Skou and Anders Visti.<br/>
