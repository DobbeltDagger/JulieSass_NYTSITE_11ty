    <p>The exhibition space Spanien19C is closing. Aarhus' oldest artist-run exhibition space will soon be expelled from the Sydhavnskvarteret, which is being transformed into a new, creative urban district. AaUOS is an instrument that compiles sound recordings from Aarhus Ã˜, the southern harbour area and Spanien19C's concert archives to perform an urban development pop music that addresses the transformation of the city's waterfront.</p>
