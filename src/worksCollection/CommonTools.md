    <p>Common Tools is a sound piece, that focuses on the interaction with the personalized computer. The work links the notification sounds of the digital production environment with recorded audio from the physical office space and the body, interacting with the computer. The sounds are triggered in a digital physics simulation on three laptops, that outlines the tools and functions of the work in front of the screen.</p>
