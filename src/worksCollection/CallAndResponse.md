  <h2>Call & Response</h2>
  <p>Ole Vinter Room ...</p>
  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Upon first encountering 'Call & Response', visitors may find it challenging to absorb the installation fully. Composed of various textiles and materials, artist Julie Sass presents a diverse array of media that coalesce into a cohesive site-specific installation.</p>
  <p>The installation envelops the visitor, expanding from the west wall to the south and east. It ultimately fades into a collage of copper fragments on the north wall.</p>

  <p>The exhibition conveys a sense of being a work in progress. It begins with a piece of black fabric on the right side of the western wall, visually connected to a larger drapery on the left through a fragment of rough, sack-like coarse fabric. Together, these elements appear to form drapes for a window that separates them. These theatrical curtains do not conceal a backstage; instead, they draw our attention to the opening in the wall that leads to Printer's Proof's production floor, which houses the Ole Vinter Room in its office space.</p>

  <p>With their folds and volume, the fabric pieces on the west wall resemble abstract paintings, bearing traces of Julie's interventions with colour pigments. Their material qualities allow pigment absorption that differs from traditional painter's canvases. The density of the black pigment used in the textile pieces creates an illusion of a void that captivates the viewer's gaze. A metallic shimmer on the black piece contrasts this. This sizeable abstract shape attempts to follow the upward trajectory of the roof but resists the sharp angle, breaking into a curve reminiscent of forms often seen in Julie's paintings. This curve is echoed by the jute fibre piece, which serves as a construction brick, bridging to the large piece of blue-grey cloth on the left.</p>

  <p>The textile's opaque, impenetrable surface and advance towards us give it an almost sculptural quality. It extends upward to create a parallel line with the black fabric on the right. It makes the blank wall space between an integral part of the composition and directs our gaze to the wall hatch,situated just below the rooftop, where a framed abstract drawing awaits. In examining it, we discover a curious symmetry between the yellow stain in the bottom right corner and the fragment of yellow cellophane attached to the top left corner of the window below, whose folds and fringed edges echo the shapes formed by the textiles.</p>

  <p>The shapes, colours, and folds of the west wall resonate with the exhibition's compositional elements on the south. Echoes of the chromatic scale, shapes, and textures can be seen in a small acrylic painting on canvas, a textile piece, and a mixed media work on tarlatan. At the same time, new artistic approaches are also introduced. The opacity of the central textile piece is contrasted on either side by Julie's exploration of transparency. Layers of transparent paint form shapes and surfaces in the exhibition's title piece, 'Call & Response'. Transparency is similarly explored in 'Sewn IMAGE', where Julie uses the textile's open structure to incorporate colour through pigment and colourful ribbons that outline the piece.</p>

  <p>The ribbons in the small tarlatan piece are mirrored by the yellow zigzagging line that traverses the large cotton canvas on the east wall. Julie's interest in texture and transparency is further highlighted in this work. Applied on gesso, the light blue background serves as a solid backdrop against which thinned paint and pigment are layered. Despite the multiple layers, the pigment does not obscure the underlying layers. This results in an immediacy and lightness of touch that starkly contrasts the exhibition's concluding compositional element, the copper collage on the north wall. A closer examination of the collage reveals, however, the same core interests that guide Julie's artistic practice: a fascination with materiality, colour, and the interplay between foreground and background.</p>
