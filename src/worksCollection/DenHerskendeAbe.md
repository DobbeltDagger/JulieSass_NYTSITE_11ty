    <p>The Naked Ape - C.I.R.K.A. Spanien19C, Aarhus. November 2008.</p>
    <p>Press release: “The installation - The Naked Ape - C.I.R.K.A. (Center for Infrahuman Research, Kommunikation og Analyse), appears to be a peripheral, and possibly completely forgotten science laboratory or research facility. The installation provides a framework for the various works of the exhibition - works that casts a glance at the man's complex and sometimes intricate relationship with animals.</p>
    <p>The exhibition title, ‘The Naked Ape - C.I.R.K.A.’ refers to representations of the world’s coherence and the origin of species in popular science. Through a burlesque and at times enigmatic discourse, the exhibition ask fundamental questions about the way human beings perceive and interact with the animals, a topic that, among other things are reflected in virtue of the way the animal is represented in art, religion and science throughout history - From mythological visions of sphinxs and gryphons of medieval conceptions of remote nation’s citizens as one-legged hybrids of animals and humans, to modern man's emotional relations to pets.</p>

    <p>The works examine not only the humanization of animals, but also discusses society's relationship to science. In a time where science and research no longer have the authority they previously had, and where research is up for general discussion and is subject to grant-awarding authorities' cost-benefit analyzes and temporary attention, the exhibition examines how knowledge is created, established and promoted."</p>
    <p>The work was done in collaboration with Lasse Krog Møller and the exhibition is supported by Statens Kunstråd.</p>
