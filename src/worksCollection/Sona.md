    <p>SoNA is an interdisciplinary experiment. It's inspired by the concept of Merzbühne from german artist Kurt Schwitters—a stage where sound, poetry, image, tableau and performance together constitute the work. Schwitters' stage is not a result of a planned choreography or score, but is rather a improvisational space, constantly undergoing transformation.</p>
